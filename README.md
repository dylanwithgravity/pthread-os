This is a Multi-Threading project using Pthreads


A message has been borken into three parts. The length of each part may be different from the rest. Each part has been encrypted
by a different method of encryption. The thress parts along with the necesary information have been concatenated again to make one
long ciphered message. The order of the parts within the ciphered text is unknown. The number of asterisks at the beginning of each
part determines the part number. The goal is to decipher each part seperately using threads. The program creates a thread named 
sifter, Sifter asks user to enter a ciphered message( a character string) as input. If the message is invalid, then the program
gives the user only three chances to enter a valid message.(From the view point of Sifter, a valid message is one with no null parts.
Sifter then creates another thread decoder which takes the message and divides it into three parts. Each part(without preceeding asterisk)
is fed to three new threads generated by decoder that are Fence, Hill, and Pinnacle. These three threads then decipher the parts if they
are valid.


Details of the 3 decrypting Algorithms are commented in the code =)
